Simulation of a digital wallet app. I built this little project as an exercise to learn more about redux and Its basic concepts. Built with react, redux, SASS and bootstrap.

- The user can deposit and transfer money to other users, and later see the records of the movements he has done.
- State management with redux toolkit.
- Random users provided with randomAPI conection.
